<Adult Mad Libs>: players, fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, verbs, and more. These words are inserted into the blanks and then the story is read aloud to receive hilarious results. There are no winners or losers, only laughter. This was my favorite childhood came and it always made me laugh so that is why I chose to build this game.

Step 8: or you can choose to press the "totally random" button that will randomly generate all the variables and randomly generate a story
